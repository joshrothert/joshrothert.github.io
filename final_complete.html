				<h1>The Dying Average: Why Baseball's Most Hallowed Metric No Longer Predicts Victory</h1>

				<p class="lead-in">For years, baseball consumers have been lied to. Enjoyers and fans alike have been encapsulated in endless cycles of writers and baseball traditionalists' nonstop talk about the importance of batting average. But don’t just take it from me, Emmy-winning MLB.com writer Anthony Castrovince said it in his own <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-players-vote-for-stats-they-value-most-c274986480" target="_blank">2018 article</a>, which surveyed current players on what the true greatest stat is, “if this isn't the outright most famous statistic in all of professional sports, it's got to be in the conversation. It's also famously flawed, ignoring non-hit-related means of getting on base and treating all hits equally.”</p>
				<p>So… let’s get into the numbers. Specifically, why I think batting average should be completely replaced with on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) permanently.</p>
				
				<div style="min-height:466px" id="datawrapper-vis-ahWtY"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ahWtY/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-ahWtY"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ahWtY/full.png" alt="BA vs OPS and Playoff Appearance, Last 10 Years (Scatter Plot)" /></noscript></div>
				
				<p>Team success can be defined in a plethora of ways. If a team has three solid starting pitchers, they will more than likely make the playoffs (see the 1993-1999 Atlanta Braves with Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine). If a team has the best player in baseball (Shohei Ohtani or Aaron Judge), a team’s odds to make the playoffs dramatically improves.</p>

				<p>But the reality is… most of these teams don’t have the depth in arms, or the best player in each respective league (if every team had the best player, there would be no best player). That’s where team statistics fall into place. If a team works harder in a certain category, it can almost certainly improve its odds to make the postseason, and thus the World Series.</p>

				<h3>The Inevitable Trend: BA's Decline</h3>
				<p>Before we analyze the data that supports the argument, we need to address the recent downtrend in BA compared to OPS.</p>

				<div class="vis-embed full-width">
					<iframe title="Batting Average vs OPS in MLB Last 10 Years" aria-label="Grouped column chart" id="datawrapper-chart-E0Jtn" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/E0Jtn/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="508" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
				</div>
				<p> Before you come at me, yes I am aware 2020 is not in the dataset. Please recall that Giants outfielder Mike Yastrzemski got MVP votes that year. And Twins righthander Kenta Maeda finished second in the AL Cy Young race. That is a "Mickey Mouse" season. End of discussion.</p>

				<p>Anyways, a visible decline is not what people who die by batting average want to see. With no correlation between BA and OPS, the OPS graph looks much stronger and more random. To add on to the strength in numbers of OPS, another chart also shows teams with success possess an OPS heavily over the median 10-year average.</p>
				
				<div class="vis-embed full-width">
					<div style="min-height:372px" id="datawrapper-vis-WUeAT"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WUeAT/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-WUeAT"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WUeAT/full.png" alt="World Series Champions by BA and OPS, Last 10 Years (Dot Plot)" /></noscript></div>
				</div>

				<p>The visual evidence from the World Series Champions plot confirms the main point: every single World Series champion in the last decade has possessed an OPS higher than the league-wide average in that span. The points are much further extended from league median compared to BA. This further demonstrates that elite offense begins with a high floor for OPS.</p>

					<h3>The Journalist's Caution and The Coach's Concession</h3>
					<p><a href="https://heavy.com/sports/mlb/jeff-passan-on-batting-average-decline/" target="_blank">Support for the OPS argument</a> really started to take center stage with senior MLB insider, Jeff Passan.</p>
					
					<p>Passan cautioned against completely writing off batting average, “Characterizing a .248 average as poor is wrong. The league-wide average is actually .246. Which I personally think is problematic. I’d love to see more balls in play because balls in play = action and forcing the defense to make a play demands skill.”</p>
					
					<p>But he does later confirm his thoughts aren’t necessarily bashing a declining statistic, but rather recognizing it as a change of pace in Major League Baseball.</p>
					<p>“It does matter. It’s just not the first determinant of a baseball player’s quality,” Passan wrote. “Sometimes I do fear the pendulum has swung too far in the anti-batting-average direction.” Ultimately, there are many paths to being a productive hitter. The takeaway isn’t to dismiss average, but to understand it as just one slice of the larger offensive puzzle.</p>

					<p>Perhaps one thing that would completely persuade Passan is someone who would actually agree with him.</p>
					<p>I had the chance to chat with Tom DiPonio, a youth baseball organization owner and coach, whose decorated career has spanned quite a few baseball timelines.</p>
					<p>“I’ve been coaching for over 40 years… batting average is my favorite statistic, because at the end of the day, you want guys on base,” Coach DiPonio said.</p>
					
					<p>Despite his own favoritism, he recognized there were two superiors that he puts above all else.</p>

					<p>“OPS is by far the best stat, if you want to look purely at numbers being indicative of performance, that’s where you look,” DiPonio said.</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="column-vis">

					<h3>The Measure of Efficiency: LOB</h3>

					 <p>DiPonio continued, “But if you want to really see if a team is maximizing that success, you need to analyze how many guys they leave on base.”</p>
					
					<p>Fair point. So instead of leaving it at a two-horse race between batting average and OPS, I added another element and analyzed the playoff teams and their respective LOB in the decade-long span to see if I could find any discrepancies, and I did. Teams bolded won the World Series that season, but there's only one lucky winner.</p>
					
					<div class="vis-embed-small">
						<iframe title="MLB Playoff Teams (top-25) with the most LOB, Last 10 Years" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-r2xhm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r2xhm/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="653" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
					</div>
					<p>
					No matter how many runners certain teams got on base, it did not get them an autobid to hoist the World Series trophy.
					</p>

					<div class="vis-embed-small">
						<iframe title="MLB Playoff Teams (bottom-25) with the least LOB, Last 10 Years" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-IExXo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IExXo/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="653" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
					</div>
					
					
					<p> On the flipside, teams were better off not leaving guys on base. I would like to think a major reason for this correlation is teams with power hitters tend to score more runs, thus clearing the bases with home runs and leaving less total guys on base. We can see that exemplified here. Coach DiPonio was absolutely onto something.</p>

				<p>You might say, whoa. Hold up now. The batting average bar chart shows the top team won the World Series that year. Did you think I wasn’t prepared??</p>

                <figure style="text-align: center;">
    				<img src="Astros.jpeg" alt="Article showing evidence of the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal." class="reduced-size">
    
    				<figcaption>Source: The Guardian</figcaption>
    
				</figure>
				
				<p>The 2017 Houston Astros were found guilty of an elaborate sign-stealing scheme. Their increase in BA and OPS came from an illegal technological system to relay opposing pitch signs to the batter. Ironically enough, the number-2 team on that graph is the 2016 Red Sox, who were also implicated in using technology to illegally decode signs, albeit not nearly as severe as the 2018 World Series champion Red Sox team that also appears on the graph.</p>
				
				<p>In the end, baseball has always been and will always be a numbers game. The rise in advanced stats, whether it be OPS, OPS+, wOBA, WAR, or WRC+, makes baseball what it is – a place to find any statistical advantage and exploit that. While many great nuggets exist, OPS reigns supreme on its quest for baseball statistic immortality.</p>
